# Project Name 
Lending Club Case Study

The objective of the Lending Club case study is to analyse the factors influencing loan defaulters and predict the likelihood of borrowers repaying their loans. By leveraging historical loan data, the study aims to build a predictive model to assess credit risk, improve loan approval processes, and enhance decision-making strategies for managing loan portfolios.

## General Information
- Project Information
The initiative is a sophisticated data science endeavor leveraging the Lending Club dataset to forecast the likelihood of loan defaults.

- Background
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers with investors. To optimize its lending processes and minimize financial risk, it is essential to understand the factors that influence loan performance, such as borrower characteristics, loan attributes, and payment history. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal is to uncover patterns and relationships within the historical loan data that can impact the likelihood of loan defaults or successful repayments.

- Business Problem
Through EDA, we aim to identify key variables that affect loan outcomes, detect trends in borrower behaviour, and spot potential risk indicators. This understanding will guide Lending Club in refining its credit risk assessment models, setting more accurate interest rates, and implementing targeted strategies to reduce default rates and improve profitability.

- Dataset used
The loan dataset contains information about past loan applicants and whether they have defaulted or fully paid the loan. The dataset contains information of approved loans only.


## Conclusions
- Factors affecting loan status and preventing credit loss
1. Rate of interest 
2. Employment length
3. Annual income
4. Loan term
5. Grade
6. Loan amount
7. Number of inquiries by borrowers
8. Number of public records of the borrowers

- Inferences
1. Borrowers with higher incomes have lower default rates
2. Longer employment duration correlates with lower default rates
3. Longer loan terms often increase the likelihood of default due to prolonged repayment periods
4. Higher interest rates correlate with higher charged offs
5. Larger loan amounts tend to have higher risk of defaulting
6. Focus on grade A more than F,G & H
7. As the inquiry increases the percentage of defaulters per inquiries also increases
8. For 1 or more than 1 public records, the percentageÂ  of defaulters is more than 0 public rec
